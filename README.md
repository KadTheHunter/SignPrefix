# IMPORTANT NOTE
As of March 15th 2021, this plugin is officially archived and unmaintained. It has no permissions, and has only been lightly tested. Although no one wants it, and it was rejected by poggit as junk, I'm leaving it here just in case.

# SignPrefix
Allows players to set their prefix via a Sign

### How It Works
- Download a .phar of SignPrefix
- Drop it into your Servers Plugins file
- Restart your Server
- Create a sign in-game that has [RANK] on the first line, and anything you want on the 2nd
- Tap the sign, and your Prefix will be set to whatever you put on the second line!
- **NOTE:** This plugin requires PureChat. If you do not have PureChat, it will not work (or even load).

### TODO:
- Add Permissions
