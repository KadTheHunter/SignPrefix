# SignPrefix
Allows players to set their prefix via a Sign

### How It Works
- Download a .phar of SignPrefix
- Drop it into your Servers Plugins file
- Restart your Server
- Create a sign in-game that has [RANK] on the first line, and anything you want on the 2nd
- Tap the sign, and your Prefix will be set to whatever you put on the second line!
- **NOTE:** This plugin requires PureChat. If you do not have PureChat, it will not work (or even load).
